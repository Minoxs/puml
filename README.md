# PUML

Access tool in: https://minoxs.github.io/puml/

Documentation is found at: https://plantuml.com/

## Why ?

I was a bit annoyed at how slow some of the PUML implementations were, so I decided to roll my own.

Currently this is using https://plantuml.com/ for generating the diagram. However, a library was rolled out to allow client-side generation, so I will be looking into that asap. 

# Credits
